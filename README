The input file should be of the form of columns, each column containing a single string (without spaces, columns separated by two spaces)

To run the code:

./a.out <path to input file> <Main memory in MB> <asc/desc> <c0> <c1> c2> ....

where <c0> <c1> <c2> are the priority of column numbers based on which the data is to be sorted; that is, it first sorts based on c0, and if for any two rows the values in c0 are equal, then it sorts based on value of c1 and so on...
